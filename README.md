# Capstone
Capstone Project â€“ Adventure Works Analytics (SQL + Power BI) 
In my Capstone Project, I worked on Adventure Works Cycles, a global bicycle and accessories manufacturing dataset, to derive strategic business insights using Advanced SQL and Power BI Dashboards.

ðŸ”¹ Phase 1 â€“ Advanced SQL Analysis
I implemented complex SQL queries to answer critical business questions, such as:

Year-over-year revenue growth and peak-performing years

Ranking product categories by sales & margins

Identifying best- and worst-selling products

Customer segmentation based on lifetime spend

Regional sales and profit margin analysis

Return rate by category/product

Seasonal sales patterns (monthly/quarterly trends)

Contribution of new vs repeat customers

ðŸ”¹ Phase 2 â€“ Power BI Dashboards
I designed and developed interactive dashboards covering multiple perspectives:

Revenue & Growth Dashboard â†’ Highlighting sales trends, YoY growth, AOV, and repeat purchases.

Product & Category Insights â†’ Revenue share, profitability by category, and SKU-level performance.

Customer Analytics â†’ Customer loyalty, repeat purchase rate, and segment-wise profitability.

Regional Performance â†’ Geographic revenue hotspots and market expansion opportunities.

Seasonality Dashboard â†’ Monthly/quarterly sales peaks, troughs, and campaign planning insights.

ðŸ”¹ Key Outcomes

Total revenue analyzed: $24.6M across 25K orders and 18K customers.

Found 43% YoY growth in 2016 but slight slowdown in 2017.

Discovered over-dependence on Bikes (96% revenue), highlighting cross-selling opportunities in Accessories & Clothing.

Identified Australia & US as top-performing markets, while Southeast & Central regions remain underutilized.

Provided actionable recommendations on seasonality, regional strategy, and product diversification.
